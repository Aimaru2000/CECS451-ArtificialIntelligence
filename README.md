# CECS451 - Artificial Intelligence
Programming projects completed in CECS451 - Artificial Intelligence

1) A-star algorithm - used to find the shortest path given a set of cities, the cities each city is connected to, and the distance among all cities connected
2) Hill-climbing algorithm and Genetic algorithm - methods used to solve the N-queens problem
3) Gradient decent algorithm - used to determine the best location of the targets by optomizing the objective function
4) Monte-Carlo simulation - estimation of pi
5) Markov chain Monte Carlo - simple simulation to predict the probabilities of landing on specific states based on the calculated transition probabilities
6) Hidden Markov Model - used the filtering method to predict probabilities of a sequence of events
7) Decision Tree, Bagging, Adaboost, and Random forest - machine learning methods used to evaluate classification accuracies on a given data set
